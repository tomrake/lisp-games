How to run:

My revisions:

This is an update of the lisp game star-trek. I started with the ciaranbradley version and reverted to the home.online.no/~jpthing/games/startrek.html star-trek.lisp file.
I wrote an asdf file, with a packaged inferred system, and the directory structure adjusted.
I added code to find the data file relative to the source star-trek.lisp file.
